## Computer Programs

Computer Programs are used to manipulate values

### Expressions

Describes a computation and evaluation to a value, eg. $20 + 21$, $\pi$, $f(x)$, (can be represented to function calls)

Python is able to evaluate expressions

### Evaluating Call Expressions (Functions)

1. Evaluate the operator (function name)
2. Evaluate the operands (arguments) from left to right
3. Apply operator to the operands
